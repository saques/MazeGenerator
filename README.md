# MazeGenerator

A simple DFS maze generator.  

# Instructions

Build the program with "make". Type "./maze X" to generate a random maze, where X is the dimension of the square matrix. Two SVG files will be generated, one containing the maze itself and the other containing the solution to the generated maze.
